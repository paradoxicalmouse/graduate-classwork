\begin{enumerate}
\item
\begin{enumerate}
\item The activation record is the data structure which stores information used by a function: the return address, parameters, and local variables and is found on the stack.
\item malloc allocates on the heap, so the value of theSum would be an address on the heap.
\item As i is a local variable, it would be stored on the stack.
\item As low is a global variable, it would be stored in the heap.
\item The instruction to call limit (line 11) would be in the code.
\item Defined symbols are symbols declared within a program. Undefined symbols are external symbols with no definition within the program.
\item \begin{tabular}{c|c}
\hline\hline
symbol & defined/undefined\\
\hline
low & defined\\
high & defined\\
main & defined\\
malloc & undefined\\
limit & undefined\\
printf & undefined\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(c)] file runs filesystem tests, magic tests, and language tests. Assuming object file named a.out for magic file list
\begin{enumerate}
\item if \$HOME/.magic.mgc or \$HOME/.magic exists, will be used in preference to /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc and /usr/share/misc/magic/*
\item /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc
\item /usr/share/misc/magic/*
\item a.out
\item elf.h
\item a.out.h
\item exec.h
\end{enumerate}
\item[(d)] tictac is identified as executable, and it was statically linked.
\item[(e)] strace runs the command after it, aka file with tictac as input and prints out the functions called. Then, grep open goes through and only shows the lines from strace's output where open was called.
\begin{enumerate}
\item "/usr/lib64/tls/x86\_64/libmagic.so.1" - not successful
\item "/usr/lib64/tls/libmagic.so.1" - not successful
\item "/usr/lib64/x86\_64/libmagic.so.1" - not successful
\item "/usr/lib64/libmagic.so.1"
\item "/usr/lib64/tls/libz.so.1" - not successful

\item "/usr/lib64/tls/libc.so.6" - not successful
\item "/usr/lib64/libc.so.6"

\item "/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc"
\item "/usr/lib64/gconv/gconv-modules.cache"

\item[(f)] blind.o is an ELF relocatable, or object file, not yet compiled to be executable.
\item[(g)] 
\begin{enumerate}
\item atoi - undefined symbol
\item g - uninitialized data, treated as undefined, but appears in heap.
\item limit - defined, appears in code section
\end{enumerate}
\item[(j)] We do not have the source code for limit; it was defined in blind.o.
\item[(l)] argv[1] is a string, or char[].
\item[(m)] It took 6 steps after the breakpoint. The values in the argument list are: the integer low at -10, integer high at 10, and str with a value of "10".
\item[(n)] x reformats an input, in this case from hex to string. The value printed out was "10"
\item[(o)] The address of the statement immediately following limit is  0x0000000000400e3c. The statement will be executed 3 times.
