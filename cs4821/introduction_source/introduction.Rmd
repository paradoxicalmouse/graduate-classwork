[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a free, open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics.  It is able to compile and run across a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows, and MacOS.  If after running through the examples today, you would like to learn more about R or complete additional examples, you can download and install `R` on your own computer.

Why use R?

* R is open-source and available across OS platforms, therefore the code used and produced here can be re-run at home.
* R is easily extended by users.
* R is a popular and professional choice for many statisticians, data scientists, and machine learning researchers.

## RStudio

[RStudio](http://rstudio.org/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R.  The RStudio IDE is free and open-source that works across Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms. 

The examples will be described and made available using [R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/r_markdown) (integrates [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), a simple formatting syntax for web pages, with R scripts) and [Sweave](http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/) (integrates LaTeX, a document formatting syntax, with R scripts).  R Studio allows easy use and creation of these documents, but requires the [knitr](http://yihui.github.com/knitr/) R package.

## Installing RStudio

RStudio can be downloaded and installed on a Mac, Windows, or Linus machine using the directions provided. 

## Using RStudio

RStudio can be started on the MTU lab machine by selecting Applications -> Programming -> RStudio or from the command line:

```bash
>> rstudio
```

The initial view of RStudio should look similar to the following:
![RStudio-start-screen](images/rstudio.png)

The RStudio environment is made of several panels

*Workspace Panel*

The workspace panel displays the variables, functions, data frames and other objects that are in the current workspace. Data can be imported from several other data formats, or cleared.  

![Rstudio-workspace-panel](images/rstudio-workspace.png)

For data loaded into the workspace, it can be selected (click on `iris`) to view the data set.

*Files Panel*

The files panel lists the files located in the current working directory.  Additional tabs for plots, packages, and help display the current figure, list of packages installed/loaded, and documentation information respectively.

*Console Panel*

The console panel is where the underlying R commands are entered.

*Scripting Panel*

The scripting panel is where R scripts (or RMarkdown documents) can be edited. 

## Installing R packages

Once you have started RStudio, for the projects used in this session you may be asked to install additional R packages.  Those packages can be downloaded and installed from the R Console. 

### Example: Installing Knitr

The knitr package can be installed via:

```r
install.packages("knitr", dependencies = TRUE)
```

On the MTU lab machines, it will first try to install the package to the network drive, then ask to install the package to a local library (accept this choice).

Note, when installing this (and other packages), the process will show comments of what it is downloading in red.

## RMarkdown

Look at the [RStudio Documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) on how to create R Markdown files and convert them to HTML.  For instance, this file can be converted to HTML using the Knit HTML button on the file `introduction.Rmd`.

The file can also be converted on the console with 

```r
library('rmarkdown')
render("introduction.Rmd")
```

### HTML Style

CSS can be used to generate "better" formatted documents. The standard format can be replaced by adjusting the yaml header for this document to include a CSS file, specifically the file `min.css`.

```html
---
title: "Introduction to R"
author: "cs4821-s17"
date: "January 10, 2017"
output: 
  html_document:
  theme: null
  css: min.css
  highlight: null
---
```

### Other formatting

Additional formating, templating and themes can be used.  Details and resources can be found at [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).  

For example, use `theme` to specify a Boostrap theme to be used, e.g., `cerulean`, `cosmo`, `spacelab`, `united`, etc..  When using your own css style, the theme should be set to "null", and the CSS style file specified in the `css` parameter.

The option of `highlight` can be used to select the syntax highlighting style, e.g., `pygments`, `kate`, `monochrome`, etc. 

```html
---
title: "test"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: flatly
    highlight: monochrome
---
```

## Render with command line 

This file was rendered from the command line using the following commands:

```bash
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('introduction.Rmd')"
```

The files needed to create this page are:

```
_output.yml
introduction.Rmd
min.css
after_body.html
images\*
```

The **\_output.yml** file consists of:

```
html_document:
  self_contained: true
  theme: null
  css: min.css
  highlight: null
  mathjax: null
  toc_depth: 2
  includes:
    after_body: after_body.html 
```
